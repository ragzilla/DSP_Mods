##### Preface

A few mods I wrote for myself for [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/).  All mods (currently) require you have [BepinEx](https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/master/) extracted into your DSP directory, which is used to bootstrap and loads these DLLs.  The compiled plugins need to be placed in your `Dyson Sphere Program\BepInEx\plugins` folder.

##### The Mods

###### DSP_MinerOverride
This transpiles the MinerComponent::InternalUpdate method to not deduct resources from the Vein (and a few other places it's tracked).  Useful if you regret not choosing the 100x resource multiplier when you started your game.

###### DSP_RecipeDumper
This adds Postfix methods to the Recipe and Item database loaders, and dumps some selected fields in something vaguely resembling TOML markup.  I was thinking about writing a recipe tool, but this seems different enough to the other ones I could use as a base that I'll leave that up to someone with actual frontend experience.
